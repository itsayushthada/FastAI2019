# FastAI2019

All the task has been done with the FastAI and Pytorch module.

| DataSet       | Accuracy  | Model Name  |     Task       |
| ------------- |:---------:|------------:|---------------:|
| MNIST         |   99.40%  |   ResNet18  | Classification |
| CIFAR100      |   82.03%  |   ResNet50  | Classification |
| Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset| 99.1624% | ResNet18 | Classification |
| Arabic Hand Written Dataset | NaN% | ResNet18 | Classification |

These are not the final results. There is still lot of scope of improvement.
