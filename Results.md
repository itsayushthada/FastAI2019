All the task has been done with the FastAI and Pytorch module.

| DataSet       | Accuracy  | Model Name  |     Task       |
| ------------- |:---------:|------------:|---------------:|
| MNIST         |   99.40%  |   ResNet18  | Classification |
| CIFAR100      |   82.03%  |   ResNet50  | Classification |


These are not the final numbers. I keep updating the results whenever I've got some time.
